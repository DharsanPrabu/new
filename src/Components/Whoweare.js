                      found my calling. Hello, I am Geetha Muthuselvan, the dreamer behind 
                      ACCHOOS. My journey into the world of floral-themed fabrics began with 
                      a simple, profound passion for textiles. My journey is one of
                      dedication, and a profound love for the artistry of textiles. I started with 
                      completely out of passion. This all began with a dream, a dream to 
                      showcase the world our unique designs, to weave stories through petals 
                      and leaves, and to bring the elegance of florals to every 
                      creative endeavor. Every fabric you find here is a piece of my soul, care{"-"}fully curated by myself. For me, this venture is not just a business; it's a 
                      story of dreams nurtured into reality, of creativity taking flight on the 
                      wings of passion. I invite you to share this vision with me. Thank you for 
                      being part of this journey. Together, letâ€™s weave our dreams.
